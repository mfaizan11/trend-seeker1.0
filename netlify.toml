  # Command to build your Next.js site
  command = "npm run build"
  # Directory to publish (Next.js output directory)
  publish = ".next"

# This plugin ensures Next.js features (like API routes, image optimization, etc.) work correctly on Netlify.
# Netlify often installs this automatically for Next.js sites, but explicitly adding it is good practice.
